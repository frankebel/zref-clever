# Changelog

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/gusbrs/zref-clever/compare/v0.1.1-alpha...HEAD)

### Added
- Provided Dutch dictionary (see PR
  [#5](https://github.com/gusbrs/zref-clever/pull/5)).

### Changed
- The `gender` key in `\zcLanguageSetup` and in the built-in dictionaries can
  receive a comma separated list as value to support types with multiple valid
  genders.
- The `cap` and `abbrev` options can now be set also in `\zcRefTypeSetup` and
  `\zcLanguageSetup`, so that fine grained control per-type and per-language
  is now possible for these options.
