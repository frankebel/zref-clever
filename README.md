# zref-clever

**Clever LaTeX cross-references based on zref**

`zref-clever` provides a user interface for making LaTeX cross-references
which automates some of their typical features, thus easing their input in the
document and improving the consistency of typeset results.  A reference made
with `\zcref` includes a "name" according to its "type" and lists of multiple
labels can be automatically sorted and compressed into ranges when due.  The
reference format is highly and easily customizable, both globally and locally.
`zref-clever` is based on `zref`'s extensible referencing system.

The released version of this package is available [from
CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/zref-clever).
